Is someone interested in this? I didn't get anything else from Rich, so
presumably he hasn't got more. Didn't rms get flamed for this? One would
expect so, but perhaps usenet was a nicer place in those days (I wasn't
there yet by a long shot).

Sure, no problem.  I knew there was a reason I kept this all these years! :-)

I'll also check through the archives to see if I have any of the contemporary
comments on it -- a quick scan this morning over coffee didn't reveal anything,
but I was barely awake, so perhaps I should try again when I'm more alive.

Cheers,
Rich
