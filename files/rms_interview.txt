   Freedom Baby! Yeah.

   Richard Stallman, hacker god and creative force that gave birth to the
   FreeSoftware/Open Source philosophy was interviewed by Linuxsoft.net
   at the LinuxWorld Expo in San Jose, California, March 2nd, 1999.

   1999年三月二日，在加州San Jose的LinuxWorld Expo會場，Linuxsoft.net訪問
   了Richard Stallman，他是程式設計玩家之神，也是讓自由軟體/開放源碼軟體
   哲學誕生的創造原力。

   [LSFT] Whis is the background of the 'GNU' project, your role in the
   free operating system concept and how Linux evolved from it.

   [LSFT] GNU計畫的背景，以及你個人在自由作業系統概念中的角色各是什麼呢?
   Linux又是如何從其中發展出來的?

   [STALLMAN] I had started a project 'GNU', to build a free operating
   system. Well, we were almost finished in 1991. We had most of the
   system. One essential piece was still missing, which was the kernel.
   We had started writing a kernel just recently. Turns out, the design
   we used was very hard to debug, it was a very advanced kind of design,
   and I hoped it would save us work, because it enabled us to use an
   existing component as part of it, but it turned out hard to debug. It
   was multiple processes sendingmessages to each other asynchronously.
   Anyway, I took up years.

   [STALLMAN] 我之前已開始一個GNU計畫，來建造一個自由的作業系統。呃，
   1991年時我們幾乎完成了。我們已有了大部份的系統。但仍缺少一個重要的部
   份，就是核心。我們最近開始寫這個核心程式。結果發現我們的設計很難加
   以除錯，它是種很先進的設計，而我希望它能為我們省力，因為它讓我們能使
   用一個現存的組成程式來當作系統的一部份，但卻發現難以除錯。多個程序以
   一種非同步的方式彼此傳送訊息。總而言之，這花了我好幾年的時間。

   In the meanwhile Linus Torvalds wrote a kernel and he called his
   kernel Linux. Well, he didn't do that for the GNU Project, he just
   decided to write a kernel. Anyway, then, people who saw his kernel
   said, "Well Lets see what we can put together with this kernel, see if
   we can make a whole system."

   在這同時Linus Torvalds寫了一個核心，他稱他的核心為Linux。呃，這核心原
   不是為GNU計畫寫的，他只是決定寫個核心。總之，後來那些看到他的核心的人
   說，"讓我們看看有什麼能跟這核心加在一起的，說不定我們能造出一個完整的
   系統。"

   Lo and behold, everything they needed was there. What they found was
   the GNU System. It wasn't all written by us, because since we had a
   higher order goal, "We're gonna make a whole system", which means,
   probably hundreds of programs. So we had to do our best, to find as
   many existing programs as we could that could be pressed into service,
   so that we wouldn't have to write every one of these components
   ourselves. We found what we could and we wrote whatever there was or
   we recruited somebody to write it.

   結果你看，他們所要的每樣東西就近在眼前。他們找到的就是GNU系統。這系統
   不是全由我們寫成的，因為我們有個更高層的目標，"我們要造出一整個系統"，
   而這表示的是大約數百個程式。所以我們只有盡力而為，盡可能地去找出許多現
   的程式加入系統中，這樣我們就不用自己來寫每一個組成程式。我們盡可能的去
   找，去寫，或者徵召人手來寫程式。

   So really this conference is about the GNU System, but they're calling
   it Linux, and whats happened is, because those people put everything
   else together with Linux, didn't realize what they were doing was
   taking the GNU system, nobody knows that now.

   所以事實上這會議是關於GNU系統，但是他們叫它Linux，而結果就是，因為這些
   將其他每一部份與Linux加在一起的人，他們不知道他們所做的就是用GNU系統，
   現在沒有人知道這回事。

   [LSFT] The Free Software concept is hard for some people to
   understand. How does a programmer do this and still feed his family.

   [LSFT] 自由軟體的概念很難讓人們瞭解。程式設計師如何在寫自由軟體之餘又
   能養家活口呢?

   [STALLMAN] You're confusing two totally unrelated issues. Totally
   separate issues.

   [STALLMAN] 你把兩個無關的事弄混了。它們是完全分離的事。

   It's not unusual to confuse them. First of all, the thing to realize
   is free software has nothing to do with money. It's about freedom. And
   the reason I started the project to make a free operating system is so
   we could have freedom and still use computers.

   弄混這兩件事並不罕見。首先要瞭解的是，自由軟體跟錢是完全無關的。它只關
   係到自由。我發起GNU計畫的原因就是要建造一個自由的作業系統，使得我們能使
   用電腦，還能擁有自由。

   If you're using a non free program, you've given up your freedom, your
   freedoms been taken away by the owner of the software, who has power
   to control what you can do. And it's a particularly horrible kind of
   power, because it's a power to prohibit cooperation. To say, "Your're
   not allowed to share the knowledge you use, with him or her," that's
   monstrous.

   若你使用一個非自由軟體，你就是在放棄自己的自由，你的自由已被軟體的所有
   者拿走，而他有控制你所作所為的力量。特別地，這是一種很可怕的力量，因為
   這是一種妨礙團結的力量。這樣說吧! "你不准與他，或她，分享你所用的知識"
   ，而那是不合情理的。

   It's basically divide and conquer, saying, "You're not allowed to form
   a community, that you must be separate alienated individuals, who
   can't help each other. I started the GNU Project to change that,
   because as long as your using proprietary software, you are in that
   bad situation. To get out of it, you have to have free software. So I
   said, "Let's make a free operating system so we can do everything we
   have to do, with free software."

   基本上這是一種分化再各個擊破的策略，好比說，"你們不准形成一個共同體，
   你們得要是分離疏遠的個體，誰也不能幫誰。" 我發起GNU計畫來改變這種情況，
   因為只要你一直使用具所有權的軟體，你就落在下風。要脫離這種不利的困境，
   你就得使用自由軟體。所以我說，"我們來建造一個自由的作業系統，好讓我們
   能用自由的軟體來做我們要做的事。"

   So we've succeeded. We've produced the GNU system. Even though people
   call it Linux, they still have the benefit of freedom when they use
   this system. But, when they put a proprietary program on top of it,
   it's as if they escape from the master, and what do they do? Somebody
   says, "Hey, I'll give you something convenient if you buckle a chain
   on." So they buckle a chain on.

   於是我們做到了。我們造出了GNU系統。即使有人稱之為Linux，當人們使用它
   時，還是能得到自由的益處。但是，當人們在這作業系統上執行具所有權的程式
   時，這就像是下面這種狀況，人們像是已逃離了支配者，然後他們怎麼著? 有人
   跑來說，"嘿! 如果你願意再扣上這鎖鍊，我就給你一個很方便的好東西。" 所以
   他們就乖乖地扣上了鎖鍊。

   These people don't care about freedom. It's not surprising they don't
   care about freedom because nobody ever talked to them about freedom.
   If you go around this conference, who's talking to you about freedom?
   They think it's just a matter of convenience and advance technology in
   getting jobs done and competitive edge, and they think that's what's
   important. They don't think freedoms important in life.

   這些人不在意自由。而這並不讓人驚訝，因為從來沒人告訴過他們自由這回事。
   如果你逛逛這會場，有誰在談論自由呢? 他們認為這只是關於完成工作的方便性
   與先進科技，關於保持在競爭的優勢，他們認為這些才重要。他們不認為自由是
   生命中一件重要的事。

   [LSFT] Ok, you've hit upon an important issue, convenience. It is
   convenient,for me to go down to the box every morning and put thirty
   five cents in and get the Mercury News. I could just as easily get a
   lot of the information that I buy the paper for, such as what time are
   the movies playing, what's going on in the world for myself, but it's
   more convenient to go....

   [LSFT] 好的，你剛提到了一個重點，方便性。對我來說，每天下樓去一個報箱
   投進五分錢然後拿出一份水星日報是很方便的。我能為自己很從買的報紙上得到
   很多資訊，像是電影上映時間，世界上正在發生的事。但更方便的是...

   [STALLMAN] I have nothing against that. We're talking at cross
   purposes. I've been talking about do we have freedom or not. That is
   not the same question as you pay money or not. These are not related
   questions. You think they're the same question. That's the confusion.

   [STALLMAN] 我完全不反對那些。我們在討論相反的事。我一直在說我們是否擁有自
   由，這跟你付不付費是不一樣的問題。它們是無關的問題，但你認為它們是一樣的
   問題。那是一種誤解。

   Most people think they're the same question, but they're not the same
   question. We are selling copies of free software. People are paying us
   money to get copies of free software. But our software's not
   proprietary. Once you get a copy, you have the freedom that I say
   everyone should have.

   大部份人認為這是同一個問題，但它們不是。我們自已也在賣自由軟體。人們付費
   給我們以取得一份自由軟體。但我們的軟體不是私有的。一旦你拿到一份拷貝，你
   就擁有我所說的那種每個人都該擁有的自由。

   So, there are these two independent questions. One is, does the
   software allow you to have freedom or does it restrict you?

   所以，這有兩個獨立無關的問題。一個是，這軟體讓你擁有自由，或是限制的你的
   自由?

   The other question is did you pay to get it or not? All four
   combinations are possible. There's gratis which means you don't have
   to pay for it, and there's free meaning you have freedom in using it.
   These are two independent questions.

   另外一個問題是，你是否付費去取得它? 所有四種組合都是可能的。免費指的
   是不用出錢就能得到它，而自由表示你擁有使用它的自由。這是兩個獨立無關
   的問題。

   [LSFT] So what should happen?
   [LSFT] 所以?

   [STALLMAN] The goal that I'm working for, and the reason why we
   developed the GNU system, is so that people could have freedom when
   they used computers. So people wouldn't be restricted and controlled
   by owners of software, as to how they can cooperate with other users.
   Whether people pay other people money is a separate question.

   [STALLMAN] 我努力的目標，以及我發展GNU系統的目的，就是讓人們在使用電腦時
   能擁有自由。因此人們不必被軟體所有人限制與控制，像是如何與其他使用者合作。
   這與人們是否付錢給其他人是不相干的問題。

   In a free software world there's still business. For example, you can
   sell copies of free software as we do, and as some companies do. You
   can sell service and support, to people who value service and support.
   For example, businesses that use software. They value service and
   support. That means there's a business there in selling them service
   and support.

   在自由軟體的世界裡還是有生意可作。舉例來說，你可以像以前一樣賣一份份的
   軟體拷貝，就像有些公司現在作的一樣。你可以賣服務與支援給那些認可服務
   與支援價值的人。像是那些使用軟體的企業。他們認可服務與支援的價值。那
   表示有賣他們服務與支援的生意可做。

   [LSFT] Could you give me three specific things that you think should
   happen to get to where you think this whole thing should be.

   [LSFT] 你能不能舉出三項你認為該發生的特別事情以達到你所認為的方向?

   [STALLMAN] The main thing is for more people to think about this
   issue. To realize there's an issue of freedom here, not just an issue
   of money or convenience or technology. That's the crucial thing,
   because if enough people want their freedom, they'll take it. They'll
   insist on keeping it.

   [STALLMAN] 最重要的是讓人們思考這件事。讓他們曉得有個關乎自由的問題，而
   不是個只關於錢，方便，或是科技的問題。這是個很重要的事，因為若有足夠多
   的人要求他們的自由，他們就可以拿到它。而他們將會堅持地去保有它。

   The GNU system, whether you call it GNU or whether you think it's
   Linux, right now offers you an alternative with freedom. That may not
   continue to be true if people do not care enough about their freedom
   to preserve their freedom. And I'm sure, having been in the Army,
   you've heard the idea, that if people aren't willing to fight for
   their freedom, they may not have it any more.

   GNU系統，不管你稱它GNU還是Linux，現在提供人們另外一個自由的選擇。如果人
   們不夠在意他們的自由以保有之，這可能無法持續成真。我不太確定，但若你待過
   海軍，你就會聽過這說法，如果人們不肯為他們的自由奮鬥，他們可能再也無法
   擁有自由。

   We aren't fighting with guns. Nobody's killing anybody over free
   software or proprietary software. It's not like that. But there is
   a battle to be fought, although it's not a battle with violence...

   我們不是用槍打仗。沒有人會為自由軟體或是所有權軟體殺人。事情不是那樣。但
   我們有一場要打的仗，即使不是一場暴力血腥的仗。

   [LSFT] An intellectual battle.

   [LSFT] 這是一場智識的仗。

   [STALLMAN] Right! And if people don't value their freedom enough to
   work hard to keep it, and sometimes make sacrifices to keep it,
   somebody will tempt us into giving it up.

   [STALLMAN] 沒錯! 如果人們不夠珍視他們的自由以努力的保有自由，有時甚至做些
   犧牲，有人就會誘惑我們去放棄它。

   Like Oracle.
   就像甲骨文司公司。

   Oracle has managed to worm it's way into the center of a conference,
   about a free operating system, so that they can offer their non-free
   software and tell you you're better off if you add their non-free
   software to your free system.

   甲古文用使盡各種方法要成為一個會議的焦點，而這會議是關於一個自由的作業
   系統，好讓他們能提供他們的非自由軟體，並且告訴你，你會變得更好--如果你
   將他們的非自由軟體加入你的自由作業系統。

   It's like going to somebody who has just run away from slavery and
   said, "Hey how bout if you sell yourself into slavery again, we'll
   sell you this cute little decoder ring."

   這就像是跑去跟某個剛從奴隸營逃出來的人說，"嘿! 如果你把自己再賣進奴隸營，
   我們就賣你這個可愛的小解碼環，你覺得這主意如何?"

   [LSFT] But Oracle can't make me buy their product.

   [LSFT] 但甲古文無法使我買他們的產品。

   [STALLMAN] That's right, but they can tempt you into doing it. As long
   as your're using their product, their chains are on you.

   [STALLMAN] 對的，但是他們可以誘惑你去買。只要你還用他們的產品，他們的鎖鍊
   就套在你身上。

   [LSFT] I could get tempted into drinking too much beer, but I don't do
   that.

   [LSFT] 我可能會被誘惑去多喝太多啤酒，但我不會那樣做。

   [STALLMAN] That's right. And there are some people who don't do that.
   That realize that drinking too much is bad for you. If people realize
   that giving up your freedom in exchange for convenience, in exchange
   for a competitive edge is foolish in the long term. Then, a lot of
   people wont do it.

   [STALLMAN] 沒錯。就是有人不會那樣做。他們知道喝太多酒是不好的。如果人
   們知道放棄自由以換取方便，換取一個競爭的優勢，長遠來看是一件愚蠢的事。
   那麼大多數人都不會願意去做。

   So that's the point. That's why the most important thing is to educate
   people, to make them aware that their freedom is at stake.

   所以這就是重點。這就是為什麼教育世人是一件最重要的事，要讓他們知道他們
   的自由已是岌岌可危。

   People should take a look at www.gnu.org. and they'll find out the
   reasons why the so called Linux operating system exists. It's not just
   a matter of engineers having fun doing engineering, it's a political
   force that actually has an idealistic cause, that has actually had
   practical results.

   人們該看一看www.gnu.org，然後他們會發現這個所謂Linux作業系統的存在理由。
   這不是只關於軟體工程師喜歡寫程式，它是一個有理想根據，確實地有實際結果的
   政治力。
