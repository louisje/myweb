   Freedom Baby! Yeah.

   Richard Stallman, hacker god and creative force that gave birth to the
   FreeSoftware/Open Source philosophy was interviewed by Linuxsoft.net
   at the LinuxWorld Expo in San Jose, California, March 2nd, 1999.

   [LSFT] Whis is the background of the 'GNU' project, your role in the
   free operating system concept and how Linux evolved from it.

   [STALLMAN] I had started a project 'GNU', to build a free operating
   system. Well, we were almost finished in 1991. We had most of the
   system. One essential piece was still missing, which was the kernel.
   We had started writing a kernel just recently. Turns out, the design
   we used was very hard to debug, it was a very advanced kind of design,
   and I hoped it would save us work, because it enabled us to use an
   existing component as part of it, but it turned out hard to debug. It
   was multiple processes sendingmessages to each other asynchronously.
   Anyway, I took up years.

   In the meanwhile Linus Torvalds wrote a kernel and he called his
   kernel Linux. Well, he didn't do that for the GNU Project, he just
   decided to write a kernel. Anyway, then, people who saw his kernel
   said, "Well Lets see what we can put together with this kernel, see if
   we can make a whole system."

   Lo and behold, everything they needed was there. What they found was
   the GNU System. It wasn't all written by us, because since we had a
   higher order goal, "We're gonna make a whole system", which means,
   probably hundreds of programs. So we had to do our best, to find as
   many existing programs as we could that could be pressed into service,
   so that we wouldn't have to write every one of these components
   ourselves. We found what we could and we wrote whatever there was or
   we recruited somebody to write it.

   So really this conference is about the GNU System, but they're calling
   it Linux, and whats happened is, because those people put everything
   else together with Linux, didn't realize what they were doing was
   taking the GNU system, nobody knows that now.

   [LSFT] The Free Software concept is hard for some people to
   understand. How does a programmer do this and still feed his family.

   [STALLMAN] You're confusing two totally unrelated issues. Totally
   separate issues.

   [STALLMAN] §A§â¨â­ÓµLÃöªº¨Æ§Ë²V¤F¡C¥¦­Ì¬O§¹¥þ¤ÀÂ÷ªº¨Æ¡C

   It's not unusual to confuse them. First of all, the thing to realize
   is free software has nothing to do with money. It's about freedom. And
   the reason I started the project to make a free operating system is so
   we could have freedom and still use computers.

   §Ë²V³o¨â¥ó¨Æ¨Ã¤£¨u¨£¡C­º¥ý­nÁA¸Ñªº¬O¡A¦Û¥Ñ³nÅé¸ò¿ú¬O§¹¥þµLÃöªº¡C¥¦¥uÃö

   ¥Î¹q¸£¡AÁÙ¯à¾Ö¦³¦Û¥Ñ¡C

   If you're using a non free program, you've given up your freedom, your
   freedoms been taken away by the owner of the software, who has power
   to control what you can do. And it's a particularly horrible kind of
   power, because it's a power to prohibit cooperation. To say, "Your're
   not allowed to share the knowledge you use, with him or her," that's
   monstrous.

   ­Y§A¨Ï¥Î¤@­Ó«D¦Û¥Ñ³nÅé¡A§A´N¬O¦b©ñ±ó¦Û¤vªº¦Û¥Ñ¡A§Aªº¦Û¥Ñ¤w³Q³nÅéªº©Ò¦³

   ¡A¦Ó¨º¬O¤£¦X±¡²zªº¡C

   It's basically divide and conquer, saying, "You're not allowed to form
   a community, that you must be separate alienated individuals, who
   can't help each other. I started the GNU Project to change that,
   because as long as your using proprietary software, you are in that
   bad situation. To get out of it, you have to have free software. So I
   said, "Let's make a free operating system so we can do everything we
   have to do, with free software."

   So we've succeeded. We've produced the GNU system. Even though people
   call it Linux, they still have the benefit of freedom when they use
   this system. But, when they put a proprietary program on top of it,
   it's as if they escape from the master, and what do they do? Somebody
   says, "Hey, I'll give you something convenient if you buckle a chain
   on." So they buckle a chain on.

   These people don't care about freedom. It's not surprising they don't
   care about freedom because nobody ever talked to them about freedom.
   If you go around this conference, who's talking to you about freedom?
   They think it's just a matter of convenience and advance technology in
   getting jobs done and competitive edge, and they think that's what's
   important. They don't think freedoms important in life.

   [LSFT] Ok, you've hit upon an important issue, convenience. It is
   convenient,for me to go down to the box every morning and put thirty
   five cents in and get the Mercury News. I could just as easily get a
   lot of the information that I buy the paper for, such as what time are
   the movies playing, what's going on in the world for myself, but it's
   more convenient to go....

   [STALLMAN] I have nothing against that. We're talking at cross
   purposes. I've been talking about do we have freedom or not. That is
   not the same question as you pay money or not. These are not related
   questions. You think they're the same question. That's the confusion.

   Most people think they're the same question, but they're not the same
   question. We are selling copies of free software. People are paying us
   money to get copies of free software. But our software's not
   proprietary. Once you get a copy, you have the freedom that I say
   everyone should have.

   So, there are these two independent questions. One is, does the
   software allow you to have freedom or does it restrict you?

   The other question is did you pay to get it or not? All four
   combinations are possible. There's gratis which means you don't have
   to pay for it, and there's free meaning you have freedom in using it.
   These are two independent questions.

   ªº°ÝÃD¡C

   [LSFT] So what should happen?
   [LSFT] ©Ò¥H?

   [STALLMAN] The goal that I'm working for, and the reason why we
   developed the GNU system, is so that people could have freedom when
   they used computers. So people wouldn't be restricted and controlled
   by owners of software, as to how they can cooperate with other users.
   Whether people pay other people money is a separate question.

   In a free software world there's still business. For example, you can
   sell copies of free software as we do, and as some companies do. You
   can sell service and support, to people who value service and support.
   For example, businesses that use software. They value service and
   support. That means there's a business there in selling them service
   and support.

   [STALLMAN] The main thing is for more people to think about this
   issue. To realize there's an issue of freedom here, not just an issue
   of money or convenience or technology. That's the crucial thing,
   because if enough people want their freedom, they'll take it. They'll
   insist on keeping it.

   The GNU system, whether you call it GNU or whether you think it's
   Linux, right now offers you an alternative with freedom. That may not
   continue to be true if people do not care enough about their freedom
   to preserve their freedom. And I'm sure, having been in the Army,
   you've heard the idea, that if people aren't willing to fight for
   their freedom, they may not have it any more.

   That realize that drinking too much is bad for you. If people realize
   that giving up your freedom in exchange for convenience, in exchange
   for a competitive edge is foolish in the long term. Then, a lot of
